Android application for selecting outfits and maximizing your wardrobe.

This is my first Github project. I'm building a small android application that will randomly select outfits that users can create. It will allow users to randomize their entire wardrobe while keeping track of inividual clothes items worn. Keeping track of individual clothes items will keep outfits with the same pants or shirts from being selected two days in a row or even selected twice in an entire week.
